This module implements post-processing for SCRFD object detection models. It provides functions to process model outputs and extract bounding boxes, scores, and other relevant information for face detection tasks.

- **scrfd_postprocess.cpp/h**: Core logic for SCRFD post-processing.
- Designed for integration with SCRFD model inference pipelines.

## Usage
Include the header and link the compiled library in your project to use SCRFD post-processing functions.
