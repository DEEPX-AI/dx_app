- **Deepx M1 Driver Version**: v1.7.1 or higher  
- **Deepx M1 Runtime Lib Version**: v3.0.0 or higher  

All required components are included in the **DXNN All Suite (DX-AS)** package.  


### Prerequisites Setup

**1. Install DX-RT Device Driver**  
To set up the build Environment, refer to **Section. Linux Device Driver Installation** in **DX-RT User Manual**.  

Once the DX-RT device driver is installed, the system should include both the PCIe driver and the runtime driver.  You can verify the installation by checking the loaded kernel modules.  

```
lsmod | grep dx

# dxrt_driver 53248 2
# dx_dma 475136 7 dxrt_driver
```

**2. Install DX-RT Library**   
To install the DX-RT library and NPU device driver, refer to **Section. Build Guide for Cross-compile** in **SDX-RT User Manual**.  

Once **DX-RT** is built, the runtime library and header files are installed in the following directory.  

- Libraries: `/usr/local/lib`  
- Headers: `/usr/local/include`  

```
set(DXRT_INSTALLED_DIR /usr/local)
```

If necessary, you can modify the installation path by editing `cmake/toolchain.x86_64.cmake`.  


### DX-APP Application Setup  

**1. DX-APP Installation Options**  
You can check the available **DX-APP** installation options by running the following command. 

```
./install.sh # --help
```
You can view more installation options by entering the `--help` flag.

**2. OpenCV Installation Options**  
If you want to enable CPU/GPU acceleration, OpenCV **must** be manually installed on your system.  
During the OpenCV build process, setting the following flags are needed.  

- `TBB=ON, IPP=ON, CUDA=ON`

If OpenCV is already installed, manually set the `OpenCV_DIR` path in your toolchain file.
```
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Linux)
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR x86_64)
set(DXRT_INSTALLED_DIR /usr/local)
set(OpenCV_DIR /your/opencv/installation/dir)
set(onnxruntime_LIB_DIRS /usr/local/lib)
```

**3. Build and Run DX-APP**  
To build `dx_app`, run the following command. 
```
./build.sh ## Use --clean for a clean build
```

To download required models and sample videos, run the following command.  
```
./setup.sh
```

Assets are downloaded and placed in the `assets/` directory. The available assets include models for Classification, Object Detection, and Segmentation.  

To test `dx_app`, run the following command.  
```
./scripts/run_detector.sh
```
You can also use the `run_demo.sh` script to conveniently run a variety of demo applications included with DX-APP. This script provides an interactive menu that allows you to quickly test different AI models and features without needing to remember or type out complex command-line arguments.

To use the demo launcher, simply execute the following command in your terminal:

```
./run_demo.sh
  0: Object Detection (YOLOv7)
  1: Object Detection (YOLOv8N)
  2: Object Detection (YOLOv9S)
  3: Face Detection (YOLOV5S_Face)
  4: Pose Estimation
  5: Semantic Segmentation
  6: Multi-Channel Object Detection (YOLOv5)
  7: Multi-Model Object Detection (YOLOv5) & Segmentation
which AI demo do you want to run:(timeout:10s, default:0)
```

**4. Resolve Shared Library Errors**  
If you encounter shared library errors (e.g., `libdxrt.so`), update the system’s library cache. 
```
# Copy your library to /usr/local/lib
sudo cp your_library.so /usr/local/lib

# Update the system's library cache
sudo ldconfig
```

### Build and Install dx_app in Visual Studio Community 2022  

To build and run the `dx_app` application on Windows, follow the steps below using Visual Studio Community 2022.  

**Step 1. Open Project Folder**  

- **1.** Launch Visual Studio Community 2022
- **2.** From the start screen, select **Open a local folder**  
- **3.** Navigate to and select the `dx_app` project folder

**IMPORTANT:** You must use Visual Studio 2022. Other versions (VS 2019, VS Code, etc.) are not supported.   

![](./../resources/02_05_Opening_dx_app.png)

**Step 2. Project Configuration**  
Upon opening the project,  

- Dependencies specified in `vcpkg.json` will be automatically downloaded and installed into the `vcpkg_installed` directory.  
- CMake will automatically generate the build cache and configuration.  

![](./../resources/02_06_CMake_Cache_Configuration.png)

**Step 3. (Optional) Edit CMakeSettings**  
If needed, you can manually specify the following environment variables in `CMakeSettings.json`.  

- `DXRT_DIR`: Path to the installed DX-RT runtime  
- `OpenCV_DIR`: Path to the OpenCV installation (if manually installed)  

```
{
    "name": "CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE",
    "value": "${env.VCPKG_ROOT}\\scripts\\buildsystems\\vcpkg.cmake",
    "type": "STRING"
},
{
    "name": "DXRT_DIR",
    "value": "C:\\DevTools\\DEEPX\\DXNN\\v2025.03-1_beta-06\\DXRT",
    "type": "STRING"
},
{
    "name": "OpenCV_DIR",
    "value": "${projectDir}\\vcpkg_installed\\x64-windows",
    "type": "STRING"
}
```

**Step 4. Register `PATH` Variable**  
Ensure the required runtime libraries are accessible with the system’s `PATH` environment variable.  

- `DXRT_DIR` is referenced in CMAKE as `${env.DXRT_DIR}`.

**Note.** If you are using `dx_app/vcpkg.json`, OpenCV will be automatically downloaded and installed into `vcpkg_installed/x64-windows` directory during CMake configuration step. 

![](./../resources/02_07_Manually_Installation_Path.png)


**Step 5. Build and Install `dx_app`**  
To build and install the dx_app application:

- **1.** Go to the **Build** menu  
- **2.** Click **Build All** (or **Rebuild All**) to begin the build process  

Upon successful compilation, the application executable will be generated under the `bin/` directory.

### Alternative Build Method: Using build.bat Script

For users who prefer a more automated approach, **DX-APP** provides a `build.bat` script that streamlines the entire build process. This script automatically handles CMake configuration, build, and installation steps.

**Key Features of build.bat:**

- **Automated Build Process**: Handles the complete build pipeline from configuration to installation
- **Environment Validation**: Automatically checks for required environment variables (`DXRT_DIR`) 
- **Visual Studio 2022 Integration**: Generates Visual Studio 2022 solution files for development
- **Organized Build Structure**: Creates builds in the `build_vs2022` directory for clean organization
- **Release Configuration**: Builds and installs in optimize1d Release mode
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error checking at each build stage

**Prerequisites:**

- **DXRT_DIR Environment Variable**: Must be set to DX-RT installation directory
- **Visual Studio 2022**: With Desktop development with C++ workload
- **CMake**: Accessible from command line

**Using build.bat:**

**Step 1. Run the Build Script**  
Execute the build script from the project root directory:
```
build.bat
```

**Step 2. Build Process Overview**  
The script performs the following operations automatically:
![](./../resources/02_09_Running_build_bat_Script.png)

1. **Environment Validation**: Verifies that `DXRT_DIR` is set and the directory exists
2. **Build Directory Creation**: Creates `build_vs2022` directory if it doesn't exist
3. **CMake Configuration**: Configures the project using Visual Studio 2022 generator with x64 architecture
4. **Solution Generation**: Creates `dxapp.sln` in the `build_vs2022` directory 
5. **Release Build**: Compiles the project in Release configuration
6. **Installation**: Installs the built binaries to the appropriate directories

**Step 3. Visual Studio Integration**  
After successful execution, you can:

- **IMPORTANT**: Open the generated solution file at `build_vs2022\dxapp.sln` **using Visual Studio 2022**
- Use Visual Studio 2022 for debugging, development, and further customization
- Access all project targets and configurations through the Visual Studio 2022 interface

**Step 4. Solution-Based Development**  
Once the `dxapp.sln` file is generated, you can use Visual Studio 2022 for comprehensive development workflows:

![](./../resources/02_10_Install_Process_Using_DXApp_Solution.png)

- **Complete Application Build & Install**: Build the entire DX-APP application and install all components through the solution
- **Individual Target Building**: Build specific components or modules independently by selecting individual projects within the solution
- **Development Flexibility**: Utilize Visual Studio 2022's full IDE capabilities for debugging, testing, and code modification
- **Project Management**: Access and manage all sub-projects and dependencies through the unified solution interface

This approach provides both comprehensive build capabilities and granular control over individual solution components. 

**Note:** The generated solution file (`dxapp.sln`) **must be opened with Visual Studio 2022**. Opening with other versions may cause compatibility issues or build failures.

**Build Output Structure:**
```
dx_app/
├── build_vs2022/           # Build directory created by build.bat
│   ├── dxapp.sln         # Visual Studio 2022 solution file
│   ├── *.vcxproj          # Project files for each target
│   └── Release/           # Compiled binaries and libraries
├── bin/                   # Installed executables
└── lib/                   # Installed libraries
```

**Troubleshooting:**

- **Environment Variable Issues**: If `DXRT_DIR` is not set, the script will display an error and exit
- **Build Failures**: Check that all prerequisites are properly installed
- **OpenCV Dependencies**: Ensure OpenCV is properly configured as described in previous sections

**Note.** The `build.bat` script is equivalent to the manual Visual Studio build process but provides a more streamlined and automated experience. Both methods produce identical results, so choose the approach that best fits your workflow.


### Run Example Demo Executable Files On Windows  

After building and installing dx_app, you can execute the demo applications using provided batch scripts.  

**Step 1. Execute `setup.bat`**  
Run the `setup.bat` script to automatically download all required models and sample videos.  

- The downloaded assets will be placed in the `assets` folder.  
- The assets include models for Classification, Object Detection, and Segmentation.  

OpenCV Dependency Handling  

- If OpenCV was installed using vcpkg, it will be located in the `vcpkg_installed/x64-windows` directory. The batch files automatically append this path in the `PATH` environment variable.  
- If OpenCV is installed manually (e.g., custom installation),  
  : You **must** manually add the OpenCV library and DLL directories to the `PATH`, or  
  : You **must** manually modify the batch file variables, `OPENCV_LIB_PATH` and  `OPENCV_DLL_PATH`.  

![](./../resources/02_11_Output_of_run_classifier.png)

**Step 2. Run the Demo**  
Once setup is complete,  

- Navigate to the `bin/` directory.  
- Run the desired demo using the appropriate batch file.  

For example, to launch the classification demo as follows (`run_classifier.bat`)  
```
@echo off
setlocal

set "OPENCV_LIB_PATH=%~dp0\vcpkg_installed\x64-windows\lib\"
set "OPENCV_DLL_PATH=%~dp0\vcpkg_installed\x64-windows\bin\"
set PATH=%OPENCV_LIB_PATH%;%OPENCV_DLL_PATH%;%PATH%
set "APP_JSON_PATH=%~dp0\example\imagenet_example.json"
start cmd /K "%~dp0\bin\run_classifier.exe" -c %APP_JSON_PATH%

endlocal
```

This will execute the classification demo using the downloaded model and sample image. The result will be displayed in the terminal and saved to the output directory if applicable.
