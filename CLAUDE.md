# dx_app — Claude Code Entry Point

> Self-contained entry point for dx_app standalone inference development.

## Response Language

Match your response language to the user's prompt language — when asking questions
or responding, use the same language the user is using.

**Technical term rule**: When responding in Korean, keep English technical terms in
their original English form. Do NOT transliterate English terms into Korean phonetics
(한글 음차 표기 금지). Established Korean loanwords (모델, 서버, 파일, 데이터) are acceptable.

## Shared Knowledge

All skills, instructions, toolsets, and memory live in `.deepx/`.
Read `.deepx/README.md` for the complete index.

## Quick Reference

```bash
./install.sh && ./build.sh          # Build C++ and pybind11 bindings
./setup.sh                          # Download models and test media
dxrt-cli -s                         # Verify NPU availability
pytest tests/ -m "not npu_required" # Run unit tests (no NPU)
pytest tests/ -m npu_required       # Run NPU integration tests
```

## Interactive Workflow (MUST FOLLOW)

**Always walk through key decisions with the user before building.** This is a HARD GATE.

### Before ANY code generation:
1. **Brainstorm**: Ask 2-3 clarifying questions — variant, task type, model. Present a build plan and get approval.
2. **Build with TDD**: Validate each file immediately after creation.
3. **Verify**: Evidence before claims — run validation scripts before declaring success.

### Mandatory Questions for App Building (HARD-GATE)

<HARD-GATE>
Before ANY code generation, the agent MUST ask and receive explicit answers to ALL 3:
1. **Language/variant**: Python (sync/async/cpp_postprocess/async_cpp_postprocess) or C++?
2. **AI task**: detection, classification, segmentation, pose, face_detection, depth_estimation, etc.
3. **Model**: Specific model name (e.g. 'yolo26n') or 'recommend' for auto-selection

These questions MUST NOT be skipped even if the user's prompt seems to provide enough context.
Even "build a yolo26n detection app" requires confirming: Python or C++? Which variant?
</HARD-GATE>

### Agent Routing (MANDATORY)

**All app building requests MUST go through `@dx-app-builder`** (the master router).
Do NOT invoke `@dx-python-builder`, `@dx-cpp-builder`, or other specialist agents directly.
`@dx-app-builder` enforces mandatory brainstorming questions (Q1: language/variant,
Q2: AI task, Q3: model) that specialist agents skip.

### Output Isolation
All AI-generated code goes to `dx-agentic-dev/<session_id>/` by default.
Only write to `src/` when explicitly requested by the user.

## Critical Conventions

1. **Absolute imports**: `from dx_app.src.python_example.common.xyz import ...`
2. **Model resolution**: Query `config/model_registry.json` — never hardcode .dxnn paths
3. **Factory pattern**: All apps implement IFactory with 5 methods (`create_preprocessor`, `create_postprocessor`, `create_visualizer`, `get_model_name`, `get_task_type`)
4. **CLI args**: Use `parse_common_args()` from `common/runner/args.py`
5. **NPU check**: `dxrt-cli -s` before any inference operation
6. **Logging**: `logging.getLogger(__name__)` — no bare `print()`
7. **Skill doc is sufficient**: Do NOT read source code unless skill is insufficient
8. **No relative imports**: Always use absolute imports from the package root
9. **No hardcoded model paths**: All model paths from CLI args or model_registry.json
10. **4 variants**: Python apps have sync, async, sync_cpp_postprocess, async_cpp_postprocess
11. **PPU model auto-detection**: Auto-detect PPU models by checking model name `_ppu` suffix, `model_registry.json` `csv_task: "PPU"`, or compiler session context. PPU models go under `src/python_example/ppu/` with simplified postprocessing (no separate NMS needed).
12. **Existing example search**: Before generating code, search `src/python_example/<task>/<model>/` for existing examples. If found, ask user: (a) explain existing only, or (b) create new example based on existing. Never silently skip or overwrite.
13. **PPU example generation is MANDATORY**: If the compiled .dxnn model is PPU, the agent MUST generate a working example — never skip example generation for PPU models.
14. **Cross-validation with reference model**: When a precompiled DXNN exists in `assets/models/` or an existing verified example exists in `src/python_example/`, run the Level 5.5 differential diagnosis to isolate app code vs compilation issues. See `dx-validate.md` Level 5.5.
15. **Mandatory output artifacts**: Every session MUST produce ALL 13 artifacts (factory, config, 4 variants, __init__.py, session.json, README.md, setup.sh, run.sh, session.log). See agent's MANDATORY OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS section. Run self-verification check before claiming completion.

## Hardware

| Architecture | Value |
|---|---|
| DX-M1 | `dx_m1` |

## Memory

Persistent knowledge in `.deepx/memory/`. Read at task start, update when learning.

## Git Operations — User Handles

Do NOT ask about git branch operations (merge, PR, push, cleanup) at the end of
work. The user will handle all git operations themselves. Never present options
like "merge to main", "create PR", or "delete branch" — just finish the task.

## Git Safety — Superpowers Artifacts

**NEVER `git add` or `git commit` files under `docs/superpowers/`.** These are temporary
planning artifacts generated by the superpowers skill system (specs, plans). They are
`.gitignore`d, but some tools may bypass `.gitignore` with `git add -f`. Creating the
files is fine — committing them is forbidden.

## Session Sentinels (MANDATORY for Automated Testing)

When processing a user prompt, output these exact markers for automated session
boundary detection by the test harness:

- **First line of your response**: `[DX-AGENTIC-DEV: START]`
- **Last line after ALL work is complete**: `[DX-AGENTIC-DEV: DONE (output-dir: <relative_path>)]`
  where `<relative_path>` is the session output directory (e.g., `dx-agentic-dev/20260409-143022_yolo26n_detection/`)

Rules:
1. **CRITICAL — Output `[DX-AGENTIC-DEV: START]` as the absolute first line of your
   first response.** This must appear before ANY other text, tool calls, or reasoning.
   Even if the user instructs you to "just proceed" or "use your own judgment",
   the START sentinel is non-negotiable — automated tests WILL fail without it.
2. Output `[DX-AGENTIC-DEV: DONE (output-dir: <path>)]` as the very last line after all work, validation,
   and file generation is complete
3. If you are a **sub-agent** invoked via handoff/routing from a higher-level agent,
   do NOT output these sentinels — only the top-level agent outputs them
4. If the user sends multiple prompts in a session, output START/DONE for each prompt
5. The `output-dir` in DONE must be the relative path from the project root to the
   session output directory. If no files were generated, omit the `(output-dir: ...)` part.
6. **NEVER output DONE after only producing planning artifacts** (specs, plans, design
   documents). DONE means all deliverables are produced — implementation code, scripts,
   configs, and validation results. If you completed a brainstorming or planning phase
   but have not yet implemented the actual code, do NOT output DONE. Instead, proceed
   to implementation or ask the user how to proceed.
7. **Pre-DONE mandatory deliverable check**: Before outputting DONE, verify that all
   mandatory deliverables exist in the session directory. If any mandatory file is
   missing, create it before outputting DONE. Each sub-project defines its own mandatory
   file list in its skill document (e.g., `dx-build-pipeline-app.md` File Creation Checklist).
8. **Session HTML export guidance** (Copilot CLI only): Immediately before the DONE
   sentinel line, output: `To save this session as HTML, type: /share html`
   — this tells the user they can preserve the full conversation. The `/share html`
   command is specific to GitHub Copilot CLI; it does not work in Claude Code,
   Copilot Chat (VS Code), or OpenCode. The test harness (`test.sh`) will automatically
   detect and copy the exported HTML file to the session output directory.
